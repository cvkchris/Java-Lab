Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args,
Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console)

In My code, a method called printFibonacci has been implemented in the series.java file which recursively calls itself and 
print the value in the main class of Fibonacci.java file.
