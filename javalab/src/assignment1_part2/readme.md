Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, multiplication, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. 
Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (Mean calculation: program reads numbers 
from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of 
numbers)

In my code, the main class is within the Calculator.java file. The Input.java file contains the methods to take various inputs for
the calculator. The Operations.java file contains the various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc. which is 
called by the main class for implementing different operations.
